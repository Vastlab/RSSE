expfilegen is a utility that aims to provide an easy way of initially generating experiment description files. 

The program should be fairly simple to use and follows the following general syntax:

expfilegen urlfile [file to append to or output to] [args]

A url file for the experimental file generator is just a plaintext file where each URL is listed on its own line. 

A description file is just a plaintext file containing a description for the experiment.
